# DrumsBiomech Project

Welcome to the **DrumsBiomech** project! This project allows you to visualize and interact with data related to the biomechanics of drumming.

## Launch the Project

To launch the project in an interactive environment, click the image below. This will open Binder with the Jupyter interface. To view the project via **Voilà** (without the code interface), please follow these steps:

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AurelieSar/DrumsBiomech/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FProjet_Drums-v2.ipynb)

### Steps to follow:

1. After clicking the **Launch Binder** link, Binder will open with the notebook `Projet_Drums-v2.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.
   
2. Once the notebook is loaded, look for the **"Render with Voilà"** button, which is located on the **upper taskbar**, near the top-right corner of the interface, to the right of the "GitHub", "Binder", and "Code" buttons.

   - **Button Appearance**: The **"Render with Voilà"** button consists of **two curved lines**, one **yellow** and one **blue**, which form a wave-like shape. 
   
3. Click on the **"Render with Voilà"** button, and Voilà will load, allowing you to interact with the project without seeing the code.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites are needed if you are using Binder to run the project online.

If you want to run the project locally, make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
