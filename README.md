# DrumsBiomech Project

Welcome to the **DrumsBiomech** project! This project allows you to visualize and interact with data related to the biomechanics of drumming.

## Launch the Project

To launch the project in an interactive environment, click the image below. This will open the notebook `Projet_Drums-v2.ipynb` using Binder with the Voil√† interface:

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AurelieSar/DrumsBiomech//main?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FProjet_Drums-v2.ipynb)

Please note that this interface can be relatively long to load, and that in case of inactivity it will reset. 
   
## Prerequisites

No prerequisites are needed if you are using Binder to run the project online.

If you want to run the project locally, make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
